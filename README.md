# Advancing Wildfire Predictive Models: A Novel Dataset for Next-Day Wildfire Spread

## Project Overview
This project compiles and organizes data related to wildfire occurrences, including various climate and environmental variables. The data is processed using Google Colab and systematically organized in Google Drive. The goal is to enhance wildfire predictive models by providing a comprehensive dataset that supports next-day wildfire spread prediction.
